This package implements a generic interface to add Feature Flags to your application. There is also built-in support for Firebase Remote Config.

## Installation

Currently only Swift Package Manager is supported. 
Swift Package Manager is a dependency manager built into Xcode.

If you are using Xcode 11 or higher, go to File / Swift Packages / Add Package Dependency... and enter package repository URL https://github.com/dehlen/FeatureFlags.git, then follow the instructions.

To remove the dependency, select the project and open Swift Packages (which is next to Build Settings). You can add and remove packages from this tab.
